## 🙌 Guidelines

- It’s **okay** if you don’t know everything — this is a test of your ability to learn quickly.
- You can use **any online resources**: Tailwind docs, MDN, Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, etc.
- **Don’t outsource the work** — we’ll know, and we’ll go through your code together in the 2nd-stage review.
- **Ask questions!** We welcome curiosity and proactive communication.

This assignment is not just about coding — it’s about how you approach unfamiliar problems and how well you translate design into real-world frontend code.
